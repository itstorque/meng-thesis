We compared this numerical result with experimental data of a voltage pulse from a slow device, i.e. large kinetic inductance, and obtained a good fit. Using this electro-thermal model, we estimated the temperature rise and the resistance buildup in the nanowire, and the return current at which the nanowire becomes superconducting again. We also show that the reset time of these photodetectors can be decreased by the addition of a series resistance and provide supporting experimental data. Finally we present preliminary results on a detector latching behavior that can also be explained using the electro-thermal model.},

Here, we break this limit by interfacing the 50 Ω load and the SNSPD using an integrated superconducting transmission line taper. The taper is a transformer that effectively loads the SNSPD with high impedance without latching. At the expense of reduced maximum counting rate, it increases the amplitude of the detector output while preserving the fast rising edge. Using a taper with a starting width of 500 nm, we experimentally observed a 3.6× higher pulse amplitude, 3.7× faster slew rate, and 25.1 ps smaller timing jitter. The results match our numerical simulation, which incorporates both the hotspot dynamics in the SNSPD and the distributed nature in the transmission line taper. The taper studied here may become a useful tool to interface high-impedance superconducting nanowire devices to conventional low-impedance circuits.},

@article{SNSPI-paper,
	title = {Superconducting nanowire single-photon imager},
	abstract = {Detecting spatial and temporal information of individual photons is a crucial technology in today's quantum information science. Among the existing single-photon detectors, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been demonstrated with a sub-50 ps timing jitter, near unity detection efficiency1, wide response spectrum from visible to infrared and {\textasciitilde}10 ns reset time. However, to gain spatial sensitivity, multiple SNSPDs have to be integrated into an array, whose spatial and temporal resolutions are limited by the multiplexing circuit. Here, we add spatial sensitivity to a single nanowire while preserving the temporal resolution from an SNSPD, thereby turning an SNSPD into a superconducting nanowire single-photon imager (SNSPI). To achieve an SNSPI, we modify a nanowire's electrical behavior from a lumped inductor to a transmission line, where the signal velocity is slowed down to 0.02c (where c is the speed of light). Consequently, we are able to simultaneously read out the landing locations and arrival times of the photons from the output electrical pulses using only two connections. We have demonstrated single-photon imaging by using a 19.7 mm long SNSPI, which is meandered into an imaging area of 286 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m*193 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m. The nanowire has a temporal resolution of 50 ps for detecting 1.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m photons. The 2D spatial resolution is 13.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in the vertical direction and 5.6 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in the horizontal direction. The maximum number of resolvable locations (i.e., the effective number of pixels) in such a long nanowire is calculated to be 590. Rather than operating an individual detector in a scanning mode or using SPD arrays, this SNSPI gives an alternative approach to taking large-scale single-photon images and measuring temporal and spatial correlation.},

With their exceptional performance, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the leading single-photon counting technology at infrared wavelengths. Conventionally, the superconducting nanowires are treated as lumped circuit elements, and their microwave properties were largely neglected. In this thesis, we engineer the nanowires into kinetic-inductive transmission lines and use them to devise new single-photon detector architectures. Through impedance engineering, we developed a superconducting tapered nanowire detector that has increased output voltage, reduced timing jitter, and most importantly, the ability to resolve photon numbers. Utilizing the slow propagation speed of electrical signals in the nanowire transmission lines, we developed a delay-line-multiplexed detector array. This two-terminal array can perform coincidence counting over a large number of spatial modes and can be scalably integrated on photonic waveguides.},

	abstract = {Information processing with very low power consumption and innovative computing paradigms are required for the development of modern technologies in which real-time elaboration of data is needed. Natural spiking neural networks are being explored for their speed and energy-efficiency. In these systems, spikes generated by neurons take the information, and synapses act as local memories and connections between neurons, allowing networks to learn and adapt to external stimuli.  Superconducting electronics for its intrinsic low energy dissipation is the perfect candidate for building bio-inspired neuronal systems. It has already been proposed a structure that mimics the spiking behavior of the neuron and can be based on two different superconducting devices, which are able to generate low-power pulses: (1) Josephson junctions; and (2) NbN nanowires. The former are widely used for their high operation speed and low power consumption. The latter are typically exploited for single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), but recently are emerging as a platform for new electronics, thanks to their ability to interface with high-impedance environments.  This work mainly focuses on the design, optimization, and characterization of the nanowire-based elements necessary for the realization of a spiking neural network. The spiking behavior of nanowire neurons has been demonstrated experimentally, but further work is needed to improve the controllability of their properties. An artificial synapse has not yet been fabricated and tested, but it has been designed, exploiting the presence of kinetic inductance, a particular effect of NbN nanowires (inductive synapse). It is able to reproduce some characteristics of its biological counterpart, like the variable connection strength, but still presents some lacks for the creation of large and versatile networks. A new structure developed to improves the performances of the inductive synapse is here proposed (nTron synapse), introducing the nano-cryotrons (nTron and hTron): nanowire-based comparators with tunable gain, that use the formation of a localized Joule-heated hotspot to modulate the current flow in a superconducting channel.  SPICE models of all the exploited superconducting devices were created, starting from experimental data and the existing model of SNSPDs, to facilitate a correct design of the nTron synapse and find limitations of the network.  Moreover, fundamental elements of the neurons and nTron synapses like (1) large kinetic inductors, (2) shunted nanowires, and (3) nTrons, were fabricated and tested.  Electrical simulations were also performed to study in depth a possible integration of nanowire neurons with Josephson junction neurons. Merging the two technologies could be useful to increase the overall performances of the network, but it generates also some problems, that are here analyzed.},

In this context, photon-detection pulses are guided in the nanowire and enable the readout of the position and time of photon-absorption events from the arrival times of the detection pulses at the nanowire's two ends. Experimentally, we slowed down the velocity of pulse propagation to ∼2\% of the speed of light in free space.

	abstract = {The temporary resistance triggered by phase slips will result in the switching of a superconductor nanowire to a permanent normal state, decreasing the switching current. In this letter, we propose an improved impedance matching circuit that releases the transition triggered by phase slips to the load resistor through the radio frequency (RF) port of a bias tee. The transportation properties with different load resistors indicate that the switching current decreases due to the reflection caused by impedance mismatching, and it is maximized by optimized impedance matching. Compared to the same setup without the impedance matching circuit, the switching current was increased from 8.0 μA to 12.2 μA in a niobium nitride nanowire after releasing the temporary transition triggered by phase slips. The leakage process with impedance matching outputs a voltage pulse, which enables the user to directly register the transition triggered by phase slips. The technique for maximizing the switching current has a potential practical application in superconductor devices, and the technique for counting phase slips may be applied to explore the behavior of phase slips.},

	abstract = {To analyze the switching dynamics and output performance of a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD), the nanowire is usually modelled as an inductor in series with a time-varying resistor induced by the absorption of a photon. Our recent experimental results show that, due to the effect of kinetic inductance, for a SNSPD made of a nanowire of sufficient length, its geometrical length can be comparable to or even longer than the effective wavelength of frequencies contained in the output pulse. In other words, a superconducting nanowire can behave as a distributed transmission line so that the readout pulse depends on the photon detection location and the transmission line properties of the nanowire. Here, we develop a distributed model for a superconducting nanowire and apply it to simulate the output performance of a long nanowire designed into a coplanar waveguide. We compare this coplanar waveguide geometry to a conventional meander nanowire geometry. The simulation results agree well with our experimental observations. With this distributed model, we discuss the importance of microwave design of a nanowire and how impedance matching can affect the output pulse shape. We also discuss how the distributed model affects the growth and decay of the photon-triggered resistive hotspot.},

A simple necessary and sufficient condition for stable convergence is given. It is shown that there are difference equations of order k for which the local truncation error (l. tr. e.) is O(h2k+1), h being the length of the step of integration. If the l. tr. e. is o(hk+3), however, the difference equation is unstable and it cannot be used. An open method of integration is certainly unstable if the l. tr. e. is o(hk+1).},

	abstract = {With the rising societal demand for more information-processing capacity with lower power consumption, alternative architectures inspired by the parallelism and robustness of the human brain have recently emerged as possible solutions. In particular, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a bio-realistic approach, relying on pulses, analogous to action potentials, as units of information. While software encoded networks provide flexibility and precision, they are often computationally expensive. As a result, hardware SNNs based on the spiking dynamics of a device or circuit represent an increasingly appealing direction. Here, we propose to use superconducting nanowires as a platform for the development of an artificial neuron. Building on an architecture first proposed for Josephson junctions, we rely on the intrinsic non-linearity of two coupled nanowires to generate spiking behavior, and use electrothermal circuit simulations to demonstrate that the nanowire neuron reproduces multiple characteristics of biological neurons. Furthermore, by harnessing the non-linearity of the superconducting nanowire’s inductance, we develop a design for a variable inductive synapse capable of both excitatory and inhibitory control. We demonstrate that this synapse design supports direct fan-out, a feature that has been difficult to achieve in other superconducting architectures, and that the nanowire neuron’s nominal energy performance is competitive with that of current technologies.},

More recently, however, superconducting devices have been developed based on the switching and thermal heating of nanowires for use in fields such as single photon detection and digital logic. In this Master's thesis, I will use resistive shunting to control the nonlinear heating of a superconducting nanowire and compare the resulting dynamics to those observed in Josephson junctions. In particular, I will use a microwave drive to modulate the nonlinear behavior of the shunted nanowire, and will relate the observed results to the AC Josephson effect. New nanowire devices based on these conclusions may have promising applications in fields such as parametric amplification and frequency multiplexing.},

	abstract = {Explicit Runge–Kutta pairs are known to provide efficient solutions to initial value differential equations with inexpensive derivative evaluations. Two criteria for selection are proposed with a view to deriving pairs of all orders 6(5) to 9(8) which minimize computation while achieving a user-specified accuracy. Coefficients of improved pairs, their stability regions and coefficients of appended optimal interpolatory Runge–Kutta formulas are provided on the author’s website (www.math.sfu.ca/{\textasciitilde}jverner). This note reports results of tests on these pairs to illustrate their effectiveness in solving nonstiff initial value problems. These pairs and interpolants may be used for implementation, or else to provide comparison targets for other new types of methods such as explicit general linear methods.},

We further discuss a new algorithm for real-data DFTs of prime size, a new way of implementing DFTs by means of machine-speciﬁc “SIMD” instructions, and how a special-purpose compiler can derive optimized implementations of the discrete cosine and sine transforms automatically from a DFT algorithm.},

abstract = {KLU is a software package for solving sparse unsymmetric linear systems of equations that arise in circuit simulation applications. It relies on a permutation to Block Triangular Form (BTF), several methods for finding a fill-reducing ordering (variants of approximate minimum degree and nested dissection), and Gilbert/Peierls’ sparse left-looking LU factorization algorithm to factorize each block. The package is written in C and includes a MATLAB interface. Performance results comparing KLU with SuperLU, Sparse 1.3, and UMFPACK on circuit simulation matrices are presented. KLU is the default sparse direct solver in the XyceTMcircuit simulation package developed by Sandia National Laboratories.},

	abstract = {DifferentialEquations.jl is a package for solving differential equations in Julia. It covers discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov) simulations), ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, algebraic differential equations, delay differential equations, hybrid differential equations, jump diffusions, and (stochastic) partial differential equations. Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.
