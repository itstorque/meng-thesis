As the size of superconducting nanowire devices increases and the influence of 
second-order effects, such as thermal or electrostatic coupling, becomes more significant,
the complexity of models required to accurately and efficiently simulate the device's 
behavior becomes more challenging.
Traditional circuit simulators used for superconducting devices tend to focus on 
frequency-domain simulation and
are not optimized for simulating superconducting nanowire geometries in the time-domain.
This thesis presents an integrated simulator environment designed with the goal of simulating
superconducting nanowires. 
The work presented in this thesis introduces: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item an integrated environment for SPICE software that extends its modeling capabilities
    optimized for superconducting nanowire devices and accompanying experiments;
    \item a simple procedure to measure the stability of circuit models used to 
    present an improved nanowire SPICE model; and
    \item an efficient Julia-based simulator optimized for superconducting nanowire devices 
    and nonlinear microwave circuits.
\end{enumerate}
