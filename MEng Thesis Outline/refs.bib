These nanowires have a large kinetic inductance in the superconducting state. The kinetic inductance scales linearly with the nanowire length, with a typical value of 1 nH/um for NbN and 44 pH/um for Nb at a temperature of 2.5 K. We measure the temperature and current dependence of the kinetic inductance and compare our results to theoretical predictions. We also simulate the self-resonant frequencies of these nanowires in a compact meander geometry. These nanowire inductive elements have applications in a variety of microwave frequency superconducting circuits.},

	abstract = {We modeled the response of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors during a photodetection event, taking into consideration only the thermal and electrical properties of a superconducting NbN nanowire on a sapphire substrate. Our calculations suggest that heating which occurs after the formation of a photo-induced resistive barrier is responsible for the generation of a measurable voltage pulse. We compared this numerical result with experimental data of a voltage pulse from a slow device, i.e. large kinetic inductance, and obtained a good fit. Using this electro-thermal model, we estimated the temperature rise and the resistance buildup in the nanowire, and the return current at which the nanowire becomes superconducting again. We also show that the reset time of these photodetectors can be decreased by the addition of a series resistance and provide supporting experimental data. Finally we present preliminary results on a detector latching behavior that can also be explained using the electro-thermal model.},

These devices offer high efficiency, low dark counts and excellent timing resolution. In this review, we consider the basic SNSPD operating principle and models of device behaviour. We give an overview of the evolution of SNSPD device design and the improvements in performance which have been achieved. We also evaluate device limitations and noise mechanisms. We survey practical refrigeration technologies and optical coupling schemes for SNSPDs. Finally we summarize promising application areas, ranging from quantum cryptography to remote sensing.

	abstract = {Conventional readout of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) sets an upper bound on the output voltage to be the product of the bias current and the load impedance, IB × Zload, where Zload is limited to 50 Ω in standard r.f. electronics. Here, we break this limit by interfacing the 50 Ω load and the SNSPD using an integrated superconducting transmission line taper. The taper is a transformer that effectively loads the SNSPD with high impedance without latching. At the expense of reduced maximum counting rate, it increases the amplitude of the detector output while preserving the fast rising edge. Using a taper with a starting width of 500 nm, we experimentally observed a 3.6× higher pulse amplitude, 3.7× faster slew rate, and 25.1 ps smaller timing jitter. The results match our numerical simulation, which incorporates both the hotspot dynamics in the SNSPD and the distributed nature in the transmission line taper. The taper studied here may become a useful tool to interface high-impedance superconducting nanowire devices to conventional low-impedance circuits.},

Modeling using the energy-balance equations and the acoustic mismatch model demonstrates reasonable agreement with experiment. The M-hTron is a promising device for digital superconducting electronics that require high fan-out and offers the possibility of enhancing readout for superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors.},

@article{SNSPI-paper,
	title = {Superconducting nanowire single-photon imager},
	abstract = {Detecting spatial and temporal information of individual photons is a crucial technology in today's quantum information science. Among the existing single-photon detectors, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been demonstrated with a sub-50 ps timing jitter, near unity detection efficiency1, wide response spectrum from visible to infrared and {\textasciitilde}10 ns reset time. However, to gain spatial sensitivity, multiple SNSPDs have to be integrated into an array, whose spatial and temporal resolutions are limited by the multiplexing circuit. Here, we add spatial sensitivity to a single nanowire while preserving the temporal resolution from an SNSPD, thereby turning an SNSPD into a superconducting nanowire single-photon imager (SNSPI). To achieve an SNSPI, we modify a nanowire's electrical behavior from a lumped inductor to a transmission line, where the signal velocity is slowed down to 0.02c (where c is the speed of light). Consequently, we are able to simultaneously read out the landing locations and arrival times of the photons from the output electrical pulses using only two connections. We have demonstrated single-photon imaging by using a 19.7 mm long SNSPI, which is meandered into an imaging area of 286 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m*193 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m. The nanowire has a temporal resolution of 50 ps for detecting 1.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m photons. The 2D spatial resolution is 13.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in the vertical direction and 5.6 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in the horizontal direction. The maximum number of resolvable locations (i.e., the effective number of pixels) in such a long nanowire is calculated to be 590. Rather than operating an individual detector in a scanning mode or using SPD arrays, this SNSPI gives an alternative approach to taking large-scale single-photon images and measuring temporal and spatial correlation.},
